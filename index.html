      <div id="post1" class="forum-content">
        <p>I’ve been exploring different automation setups using NOVAS products, and I’m really enjoying how customizable everything is. For example, I set my air purifier to run when the air quality dips below a threshold and my smart lamp to turn on as I walk into the room. It really feels like living in the future. Curious to hear how others are using these features!</p>

        <p>As someone new to the NOVAS ecosystem, I thought it might be helpful to gather some practical tips from more experienced users.

        <p>I’ve been trying to figure out the best place to put my air purifier for maximum effectiveness. The manual suggests open spaces, but I’d love to know how others are using theirs. Do you move it around? Keep it in one room? Any layout tips or unexpected placements that work well?</p>

        <p>Recently, I noticed my wireless charging dock getting warm when I charge my phone and earbuds at the same time. It hasn’t caused issues yet, but I’d love to know how others handle this. Any setup or tips that help reduce heat buildup or improve airflow around the dock?</p>

        <p>Keeping devices clean can be tricky, especially with air vents and glossy surfaces. I try to stay on top of it but worry about damaging anything. What’s your routine for cleaning your NOVAS products? Do you use any specific tools or cleaning sprays that work well?</p>

      <div id="q3" class="qa-content">
        <p><span class="author">SensorExpert:</span> Try checking your air quality manually; it could be calibration.</p>
